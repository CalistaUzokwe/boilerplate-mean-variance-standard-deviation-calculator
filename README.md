# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
This project is part of freeCodeCamp’s "Data Analysis with Python" course.  
It calculates the "mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum" for rows, columns, and the entire matrix.

## How It Works:
- Takes "9 numbers" as input.
- Converts them into a "3x3 NumPy array".
- Computes "statistical values" for rows, columns, and the full dataset.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy
- 
## How to Run:
1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CalistaUzokwe/boilerplate-mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator.git  

2. Move into the Project Folder:
cd
boilerplate-mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator

3. Install Dependencies:
pip install numpy

4. Run the Script:
python main.py
